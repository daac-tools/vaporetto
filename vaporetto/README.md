# Vaporetto

Vaporetto is a fast and lightweight pointwise prediction based tokenizer.

## Examples

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{prelude::*, stdin, BufReader};

use vaporetto::{Model, Predictor, Sentence};

let mut f = BufReader::new(File::open("model.raw").unwrap());
let model = Model::read(&mut f).unwrap();
let predictor = Predictor::new(model);

let s = Sentence::from_raw("火星猫の生態").unwrap();
let s = predictor.predict(s);

println!("{:?}", s.to_tokenized_vec().unwrap());
// ["火星", "猫", "の", "生態"]
```

## Feature flags

The following features are disabled by default:

* `kytea` - Enables the reader for models generated by KyTea.
* `train` - Enables the trainer.
* `portable-simd` - Uses the [portable SIMD API](https://github.com/rust-lang/portable-simd) instead
  of our SIMD-conscious data layout. (Nightly Rust is required.)

The following features are enabled by default:

* `cache-type-score` - Enables caching type scores for faster processing. If disabled, type scores are calculated in a straightforward manner.
* `fix-weight-length` - Uses fixed-size arrays for storing scores to facilitate optimization. If disabled, vectors are used instead.
* `tag-prediction` - Enables tag prediction.
